This is a summary of the process of accessing and downloading the dataset.

Sequence dataset were downloaded from GISADID database

We aimed to have ~5000 sequences for each of the 5 SARS-CoV-2 variants. Ensure you have regional and variant balance in the dataset.

Sequences were downloaded from the SARS-CoV-2 VIPR database using the following criteria:
	-	Selected by region (Africa)
	-	Gene Symbol - S
	-	Strain name
	
	
	
Sequences were downloaded from NCBI SARS-CoV-2 database.

The Pango lineage ID was used to differentiate the variants, and specified ones isolated from human origin.

Sequences downloaded based on region

For Alpha variant ID B.1.1.7
A total of 5547 sequences downloaded

Regions with fewer sequences select all. For those with thousands, preselect regions

The extract the Spike protein gene using blast functions.
